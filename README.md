These are solutions that I have written to the cryptopals crypto challenges (available at cryptopals.com).

The solutions are written in Python. When I started writing, I had little to no knowledge of python or programming. This project was a way for me to learn to code and to learn a bit about cryptography. I've really enjoyed the process so far. As I've progressed I've been learning about some more advanced python techniques like exception handling and classes. I'm in two minds about whether to go back and edit earlier code to make it look better. I think it would be good practice and it would make the project feel more complete. However, on the other hand, I'm quite lazy.
