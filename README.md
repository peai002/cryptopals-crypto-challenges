<h1> Cryptopals </h1>


These are solutions that I have written to the cryptopals crypto challenges (available at the <a href="https://www.cryptopals.com"> cryptopals website</a>.)

The solutions are written in Python. When I started writing, I had little to no knowledge of python and programming.
This project was a way for me to learn to code and to learn a bit about cryptography. I've really enjoyed the process so far. As I've progressed I've been learning about some more advanced python techniques like exception handling and classes.

I'm in two minds about whether to go back and edit earlier code to make it look better. I think it would be good practice and it would make the project feel more complete.
However, on the other hand, I'm quite lazy, so I think I'll try and incorporate more sophistication as I go along.

I haven't uploaded code / solutions for every challenge. Usually this is because some of the challenges within a set are fairly simple extensions of an earlier challenge. 

<h1> Set 1 </h1>

These challenges were very useful to me in terms of learning how python works. I had a little bit of difficulty getting my head around how python handles/ stores/ encodes (bit/byte/hex/ ) strings. 

<h2> Set 2 </h2>


<h2> Set 3 </h2>
